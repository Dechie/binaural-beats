# binaural beats

A flutter app for playing binaural beats. Binaural beats are sound waves of slightly different frequencies played 
to the two ears. This helps the brain stay more focused. The app is designed to work only when earphones are plugged.

this app was inspired by [Andrew Huberman's video](https://youtu.be/yb5zpo5WDG4).
